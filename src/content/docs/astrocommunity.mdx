n, AstroCommunity is installed as a plugin and then each entry is included with an `import` statement. It is important that these imports happen after the main AstroNvim import and before the user's `plugins/` folder. This guarantees that the user modifications made on top of AstroCommunity will happen after all included specs are resolved. In the provided [AstroNvim Template](https://github.com/AstroNvim/template) these should go in the `lua/community.lua` file. Here is an example:

```lua title="lua/community.lua"
return {
  -- Add the community repository of plugin specifications
  "AstroNvim/astrocommunity",
  -- example of importing a plugin
  -- available plugins can be found at https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity
  { import = "astrocommunity.colorscheme.catppuccin" },
  { import = "astrocommunity.completion.copilot-lua" },
  -- example of importing an entire language pack
  -- these packs can set up things such as Treesitter, Language Servers, additional language specific plugins, and more!
  { import = "astrocommunity.pack.rust" },
  { import = "astrocommunity.pack.python" },
}
```
